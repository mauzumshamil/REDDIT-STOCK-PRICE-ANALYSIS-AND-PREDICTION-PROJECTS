# Reddit Stock Price Analysis Projects

This repository contains a series of projects focused on analyzing Reddit stock data. Each project explores different aspects of the data and applies various techniques for analysis and prediction.

## 1. Project: Closing Price Stock Prediction with Machine Learning

In this project, the goal was to predict the closing price of Reddit stocks using machine learning techniques. The following steps were undertaken:

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Cleaned and prepared the Reddit stock dataset for analysis.
  - Conducted feature engineering to extract relevant features for prediction.

- **Model Selection and Training**:
  - Implemented machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
  - Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).

- **Predictive Analysis**:
  - Predicted the closing price of Reddit stocks.
  - Utilized the trained models to forecast stock prices for the next 30 days.

## 2. Project: Reddit Stock Price Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis

This project aimed to optimize stock portfolios based on Reddit stock data and analyze the associated risks. Key steps include:

- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Utilized techniques such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize stock portfolios.
  - Balanced portfolios based on risk tolerance and return objectives.

- **Risk Analysis**:
  - Conducted risk analysis using metrics such as standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio.
  - Evaluated the risk-return tradeoff for different portfolio compositions.

## 3. Reddit Stock Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on Reddit stock data. The analysis included:

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Utilized matplotlib and seaborn libraries to visualize stock data distributions, trends, and correlations.
  - Generated descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's characteristics.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Conducted statistical tests to uncover relationships and patterns within the data.

## 4. Reddit Stock Price Analysis Dashboard by Mauzum Shamil

This project involved creating a Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of Reddit stock price analysis. The dashboard includes:

- **Visual Representation**:
  - Utilized various Power BI visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent stock price trends, correlations, and portfolio performance.

- **Interactivity**:
  - Implemented interactive features allowing users to filter and drill down into specific aspects of the data.

- **Insights and Analysis**:
  - Provided insights and analysis derived from the Reddit stock data.
